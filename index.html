            <p>I have been a Web Designer for over 15 years, I can use the following and have knowlege in css, html and
                the Adobe Cretive Suite.
            </p>
            <p>I am attending this course as I am wish to extend my knowledge of JavaScript and Python, which at the
                present moment is limited. I was made redundant two years ago and have since then struggled to find full
                time employment as most front-end developer positions require
                JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>Ideally I would like to go in to Project Management as I feel my experience as being a Front-End
                Developer would help
                me work with developers and business. I have attended scrums and worked in an Agile environment before.
