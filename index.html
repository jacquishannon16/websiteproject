            <p>I have been a Web Designer for over 15 years, I can use the following and have knowledge in CSS, HTML and
               the Adobe Creative Suite.
            </p>
            <p>I am attending this course as I am wish to extend my knowledge of JavaScript and Python, which at the
                present moment is limited. I was made redundant two years ago and have since then struggled to find full
                time employment as most front-end developer positions requires JavaScript, jQuery and other programming
                languages.
            </p>
            <p>Ideally I would like to go in to Project Management as I feel my experience as being a front-end
                developer would help me work with developers and the business. I have attended daily scrums and worked
                in an Agile environment before. However I still enjoy doing web design and think I could master the programming
                would be happy being a front-end developer.
