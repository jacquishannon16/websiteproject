            <p>Changes in technology and new business models have transformed social life and business practices.
                Smartphones, social media, texting, online shopping, emailing, and Webinars have all become
                essential tools of business because that’s where customers, suppliers, and colleagues can be found.
                Information technology is too ingrained in everyone’s lives for modern businesses to ignore from a
                customer perspective. From a resource perspective, IT allows for new opportunities in problem
                solving along with more efficient practices in day to day working.</p>

            <p><strong>Lack of the right expertise:</strong> There’s a common misconception that digital
                projects only need “digital people.” But every digital project should have someone with business process
                management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end
                operational processes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Limited digital strategy:</strong> Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of
                one department or initiative, rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and
                business goals. Define specifically what success looks like for the project and how
                it contributes to the company’s business strategy before moving forward.

            <p><strong>Overambition:</strong> Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is
                better than perfect” mantra tends to result in projects that drag on way past their deadline.
                Better to deliver in stages or phases and advice of new releases and updates carried out.

    <button class="accordion">Q: 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p class="heading-one-italics">- how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</p>
        <p>A good idea would be to take a close look at the solution(s) and ask yourself a few questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Is it compatible with my current solution(s)?</li>
            <li>Does it do everything I need it to do?</li>
            <li>Is it better than my current solution?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>SOME IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN BUYING IT SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE</h3>
        <p>COMPATIBILITY:</p>
        <p>Integration and compatibility are key and If a solution doesn’t play nice with your current setup,
            it’s probably not worth your time.
        </p>
        <p>FUNCTIONALITY:</p>
        <p>The sole purpose of software and automation is to free up manpower to focus on things that require more
            creativity
            and involve less drudgery. If the solution needs a lot of engineering time to setup and build features,
            a closer look needs to be taken on whether the invested extra time is going to be worth the benefits.</p>
        <p>Suppliers that offer pilot programs should be a first choice here as pilot programs are a
            great way to check just how feasible a certain solution is. A pilot program is like a
            test-run and involves running the program on a small scale to better understand the large scale
            implications.</p>
        <p>PRICE:</p>
        <p>: The most important factor is the price. How much a solution costs is just part of the picture,
            how much it costs in comparison to your current solution proves whether it is viable.
            A lot of people on a strict budget might want to look at price before anything else since if something’s
            outside the budget, there’s no point wasting time with it.
            In contrast, people with a more flexible budget feel price isn’t the most important factor.
        </p>
        <p>CREDIBILITY:</p>
        <p>If well established companies are already using the solutions you’re about to buy, that’s a
            major positive sign for you. It’s also good to look at companies within your sector that has
            worked with for them in the past, this could be a good indicator of whether the solution will be
            good for you or not.
        </p>
        <p>USER FRIENDLINESS:</p>
        <p>The most important factor is the price. How much a solution costs is just part of the picture,
            how much it costs in comparison to your current solution proves whether it is viable. A lot of
            people on a strict budget might want to look at price before anything else since if something’s outside the
            budget, there’s no point wasting time with it. In contrast, people with a more flexible budget feel price isn’t the
            most important factor.
        </p>
        <p>AGILITY:</p>
        <p>Look for a company’s latest updates, see what servers they use, check if they’re using the latest technology
            like containers or AI and look for how flexible they are with regards to change and innovation.</p>
        </p>
        <p>EXIT STRATEGY</p>
        <p>A good idea to always have a clear exit strategy in case you outgrow a certain solution or
            the budget is too low.

            impact digital projects?

        <p>Industries that provide marketing, business, process and system support services. A number of
            organisations provide process or system management services. All of these companies will
            become processors of personal data on behalf of their customer. While their controllers need
            to be <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> compliant,
            <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> also demands that processors be
            GDPR compliant, and they have the same liability if they do not fulfil obligations. These
            organisations will include cloud-based services, platform-based services.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Data gathering and profiling:</strong> Reaching out to the individuals by communicating the product
            on offer.
            This can take the form of one-to-one electronic communications (e.g. email, SMS, other push notification
            or instant messaging) or even targeting based on specific profile groups or segments. The more personal data
            is
            used in marketing activities, the more challenging it becomes for organisations
            to ensure compliance.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Targeting:</strong> Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or
            initiative, rather than
            contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals. Define specifically what success
