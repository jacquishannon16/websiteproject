                making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?

                <p><strong>Trello:</strong> Trello is a project management software system available online, therefore
                    you do not need to down it is also open-source (free if you provide your email address) has a simple navigation and
                    uses drag and drop when you wish to move cards to lists for example: To Do List to Completed List.
                    You can share with team members, simply by inviting them using their email address and create due
                    dates and notifications for example if you are added to a card, board or team which will then send you alerts.
                    In the past I have used Microsoft Excel which although efficient requires a lot of setting up and
                    more difficult to share. I have added a url which is for the trello board I have set up for this project.

                </p>
                <p><strong>Visual Studio Code:</strong> is my favorite code editor as I have in the past used Adobe
                    Dreamweaver, Notepad++ and Notepad. The syntax highlighter, makes it very easy to code especially when learning a new programming
                    language and gives intellisense which will complete the code for you, when you start typing. Visually it is also very
                    helpful for a beginner, I really like the color coding and automatic error checking. Debugging directly from the
                    editor which again helps when learning. It has an Interactive Playground it is a special page that goes through common
                    keyboard shortcuts i.e. and concepts like multiple cursors, split panes, and keyboard shortcuts.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Codepen:</strong> Is an online tool so you do not need to download it to use it. You can easy
                    code in online and copy paste the code to a local editor for further editing. This tool is good for starting out if you have
                    not used an editor before and very simplistic in its approach. It will also do syntax however you are required to Cntrl
                    space for each piece of code whereaas with Visual Studio Code you only need Sturn it on once. Codepen you can write
                    tiny little bits of HTML/CSS/JS code and get an immediate visual display.

            <div class="panel">
                <p class="heading-one-italics">E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</p>
                <p>All the tools were appopriate however there should made available for image editing. As I have
                    already said Codepen is a good tool but is very basis whereas Visual Studio Code gives you a lot more options. Trello is also a useful
                    tool for project planning your site and sharing with other team members.
