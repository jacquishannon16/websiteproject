        <div class="panel">
            <p>Internet copyright laws give the original authors or artists the right to exclude others from copying
                their work or claiming it as their own. While online copyright protection does not protect facts,
                ideas, systems, or methods of operation, it may protect the way these things are expressed.</p>
            <p>Web pages and their contents are covered by copyrights. These rights extend to the:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall design</li>
                <li>Links</li>
                <li>Original text</li>
                <li>Graphics</li>

        <button class="accordion">Q: 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that
            people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <ul>
                <li>If a web page includes visual content (graphic images such as photos), a person who is blind can not
                    see them. These individuals might access the computer's output text-to-speech technology known as
                    a "screen reader". Graphics must be accompanied (in the html) with alternate text that describes
                    the content of the graphics for anyone who is unable to see visual content. You will see I have
                    added alternative text to my home page image with my name alt="Photograph of Jacqui Shannon".
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a web page has buttons, controls, menus, form fields, etc., that require a user to click on
                    them with a mouse, users with physical disabilities who are unable to operate a mouse will be
                    unable to access these controls. All controls should be operable with a keyboard as well. I have addded labels on
                    my form which again assist with usabliity.

        <button class="accordion">Q: 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <ul>
                <li>CSS files - Cascading StyleSheet files can help define font, size, color, spacing, border and
                    location of HTML
                    information on a web page,
                    and can also be used to create a continuous look throughout multiple pages of a website.</li>
                <li>HTML files - It is used to format text, tables, images, and other content that is displayed on a
                    webpage.
                    HTML files are widely used on the web as most pages within static websites have an ".html"
                    extension.</li>
                <li>JavaScript files -
                    <p>JavaScript is used in Web development to do such things as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>change a formatted date</li>
                        <li>Cause a linked-to page to pop up in a new window</li>
                        <li>Cause text or an image to change during a mouse rollover</li>
                        <li>JS file is used mainly to run client side JavaScript code on a webpage. The JS file
                            contains all the HTML HEAD and BODY objects in the tags of an HTML page.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>GIF - Graphics Interchange Format - the most common image
                format on the Internet - our browser can display them. </li>
            <li>JPEG - Another very common image file format, mainly used for photos. File sizes for JPG tend to be
                larger than a GIF.</li>
